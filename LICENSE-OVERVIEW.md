# License Overview

LLUT (Local Law Update Tracker) is available under a **dual-license model**. You may choose to use this software under either:

1. **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)** — Free and open source
2. **Commercial Proprietary License** — For closed-source and SaaS use

## Which License Should I Choose?

### Use the AGPL License (Free) If You:

- Are an individual user using LLUT for personal purposes
- Are a nonprofit organization or NGO
- Are willing to share your modifications as open source under AGPL-3.0-or-later
- Are deploying LLUT as a network service and will provide source code to all users
- Want to contribute back to the open source community

### Use the Commercial License (Paid) If You:

- Want to use LLUT in a closed-source/proprietary application
- Want to modify LLUT without releasing your changes as open source
- Want to offer LLUT as a hosted/SaaS service without disclosing your source code
- Want to integrate LLUT into commercial software without AGPL obligations
- Need legal assurances beyond what the AGPL provides

## What is the AGPL License?

The AGPL-3.0-or-later is a free and open source license that requires:

- **Source Code Disclosure**: If you modify LLUT and run it as a network service (including SaaS), you must make your modified source code available to users
- **Copyleft**: Any derivative works must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later
- **Attribution**: You must preserve copyright notices and license information
- **No Warranty**: The software is provided "as is" without warranties

The AGPL is perfect for individuals, researchers, nonprofits, and organizations committed to open source.

## What is the Commercial License?

The Commercial License allows you to:

- Use LLUT in closed-source applications
- Make proprietary modifications without disclosure
- Deploy LLUT as a SaaS/hosted service without sharing source code
- Integrate LLUT into commercial products
- Receive patent grants and protections

The Commercial License requires a paid agreement. Contact us for pricing and terms.

## Important Notes

### You Must Choose One License

You cannot use LLUT under both licenses simultaneously for the same deployment or product. Choose the license that best fits your use case.

### Mixing Code

- Code you receive under AGPL remains AGPL
- Code you receive under Commercial License has commercial terms
- You cannot relicense AGPL code as proprietary

### No Legal Advice

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I try LLUT before purchasing a commercial license?

Yes. You can evaluate LLUT under the AGPL license. If you decide to use it commercially without complying with AGPL terms, you must purchase a commercial license before deployment.

### What if I'm a small company or startup?

Companies of any size must either comply with the AGPL (including source disclosure for network use) or purchase a commercial license. We may offer startup-friendly pricing — contact us to discuss.

### Can I use LLUT internally without a commercial license?

If you use LLUT purely internally (not as a network service accessible to others), the AGPL's network provision may not apply. However, if you modify LLUT and distribute it, even internally, AGPL terms apply. Consult legal counsel for your specific case.

### What about contributions to the project?

All contributions to the LLUT project will be licensed under the same dual-license model. Contributors may be asked to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) granting us the right to license their contributions under both AGPL and commercial terms.

### Does the commercial license include support?

Commercial licenses may include support options. Contact us for details on support packages and service level agreements.
